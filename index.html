  <h1>What Determines Victory in League of Legends?</h1>
  <p>
    This prototype explores how early-game gold advantage at 10 minutes relates to win rate
    in professional League of Legends matches. Below is our first interactive visualization
    based on team-level data aggregated from Oracle’s Elixir.
  </p>

  <div id="chart-container">
    <h2>Figure 1 — 10-Minute Gold Difference vs Win Rate</h2>
    <p style="max-width: 640px;">
      The gold difference between teams at the 10-minute mark is a powerful predictor of victory.
      Once a team is ahead by more than +1k gold, its chance of winning rises sharply, indicating
      how decisive early tempo advantages are in professional play.
    </p>

  <h2>What have you done so far?</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 800px;">
    So far, we have selected our dataset from Oracle&rsquo;s Elixir and explored more than 150,000 rows of
    professional League of Legends match data. We cleaned the player-level data and aggregated it into a
    team-level dataset containing gold difference, kills, objectives, towers, and vision metrics. We produced
    our first statistical visualization examining how early gold difference at 10 minutes correlates with win
    rate. We also built the initial page structure for our explorable explanation and implemented a simple
    interactive D3 bar chart as our prototype.
  </p>

  <h2>What will be the most challenging part?</h2>
  <p style="max-width: 800px;">
    The most challenging part will be designing interactive visualizations that are both intuitive and meaningful.
    Since League of Legends has many correlated variables, we must represent them in a way that avoids clutter and
    highlights clear insights. Implementing smooth interactions in D3.js will also take time, especially filtering
    by league, year, or metric. Finally, assembling these components into a polished explorable explanation will
    require careful layout and storytelling.
